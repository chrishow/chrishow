# Hi!

I'm Chris How. 

I have almost 25 years experience as a web/web-app developer.

My main focuses are:
+ PHP
+ Laravel
+ CSS
+ Javascript
+ SQL
+ Linux admin

I'm available for freelance work/short-term gigs, consultancy and longer contracts. 

I also do a lot of WordPress (though I'm trying to pivot away from it), and am increasing my exposure with AI and LLMs. 

I'm based in Spain. Native English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and working Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.
