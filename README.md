# Hi!

I'm Chris How, a seasoned web and web-app developer with nearly 25 years of experience. My expertise spans PHP, Laravel, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and Linux administration.

While I have extensive experience with WordPress (who hasn't?), I currently pivoting away from that, concentrating on Laravel (I've been using it since v2!) and diving into AI and LLMs.

Currently available for freelance adventures, short-term gigs, consultancy quests, and epic contracts. Let's build some digital kingdoms together!

I am based in Spain, am a native English speaker ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, and I have working proficiency in Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸. 

Feel free to reach out for professional collaborations or inquiries.
